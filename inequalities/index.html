<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this course, we will see how to solve first and second degree inequalities, as well as some special cases.</p>
<p>It's recommended to first view the previous courses: <a href="/introductory-concepts/">"Introductory Concepts"</a> and <a href="/equations/">"Equations"</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-is-an-inequality">What Are Inequalities</h2>
<p>In general, an inequality is a comparison that includes numbers as well as a letter called a variable.</p>
<p>Our goal is to find all the numbers which, if substituted in place of the variable, make the inequality true. These numbers are usually "next to each other" and are written as an interval or a union of intervals.</p>
<p>Typically the variable is denoted by \(x\), but it can be any letter (except, of course, letters that have other uses such as \(π\)).</p>
<ul>
<li>Inequalities in which the highest power of the variable is 1 (i.e., we only have \(x\)) are called first-degree (or linear) inequalities.</li>
<li>Inequalities in which the highest power of the variable is 2 (i.e., we have \(x^2\) and possibly \(x\)) are called second-degree (or quadratic) inequalities.</li>
<li>Similarly for higher powers.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="inequalities-degree-1">First-Degree Inequalities</h2>
<!--space for ad-->
<p>The forms of these inequalities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(ax+b \gt 0\)</li>
<li>\(ax+b \ge 0\)</li>
<li>\(ax+b \lt 0\)</li>
<li>\(ax+b \le 0\)</li>
</ul>
<p>All with \(a,b \in \mathbb{R}\).</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>In each case, we need to keep the \(x\) on one side of the inequality and move the numbers to the other side.</p>
<p>In a previous course we saw that it's allowed to add the same number <u>to both</u> sides of an inequality, so by adding \(-b\) we get:</p>
<ul>
<li class="math-container">\(! \quad ax+b \gt 0 \iff ax+b-b \gt -b \iff ax \gt -b\)</li>
<li class="math-container">\(! \quad ax+b \ge 0 \iff ax+b-b \ge -b \iff ax \ge -b\)</li>
<li class="math-container">\(! \quad ax+b \lt 0 \iff ax+b-b \lt -b \iff ax \lt -b\)</li>
<li class="math-container">\(! \quad ax+b \le 0 \iff ax+b-b \le -b \iff ax \le -b\)</li>
</ul>
<p>We don’t need to write every time that we add the same number on both sides. We just remember that when moving a number or variable from one side of the inequality to the other, we change its sign.</p>
<p>Now there are 3 cases:</p>
<h4>If \(a \gt 0\)</h4>
<p>We divide both sides by \(a\), and the inequality keeps its direction (i.e., the \(\gt,\ge,\) etc. stay the same):</p>
<ul>
<li class="math-container">\(! \quad ax \gt -b \iff \cfrac{ax}{a} \gt -\cfrac{b}{a} \iff x \gt -\cfrac{b}{a} \iff x \in \left(-\cfrac{b}{a},+\infty\right)\)</li>
<li class="math-container">\(! \quad ax \ge -b \iff \cfrac{ax}{a} \ge -\cfrac{b}{a} \iff x \ge -\cfrac{b}{a} \iff x \in \left[-\cfrac{b}{a},+\infty\right)\)</li>
<li class="math-container">\(! \quad ax \lt -b \iff \cfrac{ax}{a} \lt -\cfrac{b}{a} \iff x \lt -\cfrac{b}{a} \iff x \in \left(-\infty,-\cfrac{b}{a}\right)\)</li>
<li class="math-container">\(! \quad ax \le -b \iff \cfrac{ax}{a} \le -\cfrac{b}{a} \iff x \le -\cfrac{b}{a} \iff x \in \left(-\infty,-\cfrac{b}{a}\right]\)</li>
</ul>
<h4>If \(a \lt 0\)</h4>
<p>We divide both sides by \(a\), but the inequality flips direction since \(a\) is negative (i.e., \(\lt\) becomes \(\gt\), \(\gt\) becomes \(\lt\), etc.):</p>
<ul>
<li class="math-container">\(! \quad ax \gt -b \iff \cfrac{ax}{a} \lt -\cfrac{b}{a} \iff x \lt -\cfrac{b}{a} \iff x \in \left(-\infty,-\cfrac{b}{a}\right)\)</li>
<li class="math-container">\(! \quad ax \ge -b \iff \cfrac{ax}{a} \le -\cfrac{b}{a} \iff x \le -\cfrac{b}{a} \iff x \in \left(-\infty,-\cfrac{b}{a}\right]\)</li>
<li class="math-container">\(! \quad ax \lt -b \iff \cfrac{ax}{a} \gt -\cfrac{b}{a} \iff x \gt -\cfrac{b}{a} \iff x \in \left(-\cfrac{b}{a},+\infty\right)\)</li>
<li class="math-container">\(! \quad ax \le -b \iff \cfrac{ax}{a} \ge -\cfrac{b}{a} \iff x \ge -\cfrac{b}{a} \iff x \in \left[-\cfrac{b}{a},+\infty\right)\)</li>
</ul>
<h4>If \(a=0\)</h4>
<ul>
<li>\(0 \gt -b\)</li>
<li>\(0 \ge -b\)</li>
<li>\(0 \lt -b\)</li>
<li>\(0 \le -b\)</li>
<li>In all 4: If the inequality is true, then the solution is \(x \in \mathbb{R}\), while if it's false, the inequality has no solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li class="math-container">\(! \quad 8x+16 \le 0 \iff 8x \le -16 \iff x \le -2 \iff x \in (-\infty,-2]\)</li>
<li class="math-container">\(! \quad -13x+5 \gt 0 \iff -13x \gt -5 \iff x \lt \cfrac{-5}{-13} \iff x \lt \cfrac{5}{13} \iff x \in \left(-\infty,\cfrac{5}{13}\right)\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually inequalities won't initially be in one of the above forms, so we'll need to simplify them into those forms. We do this by "moving" all \(x\) terms to the left and all numbers to the right (changing the sign when changing sides in the inequality) and simplifying. For example:</p>
<p class="math-container">\(! \, 5x-2-x \lt 18x+9-14x \iff 5x-x-18x+14x \lt 9+2 \iff 0x \lt 11 \iff 0 \lt 11 \iff x \in \mathbb{R}\)</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="inequalities-degree-2">Second-Degree Inequalities</h2>
<!--space for ad-->
<p>The forms of these inequalities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(ax^2+bx+c \gt 0\)</li>
<li>\(ax^2+bx+c \ge 0\)</li>
<li>\(ax^2+bx+c \lt 0\)</li>
<li>\(ax^2+bx+c \le 0\)</li>
</ul>
<p>All with \(a,b \in \mathbb{R}\).</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>First, note that \(ax^2+bx+c\) with \(a \neq 0\) is called a trinomial, and the solutions to the equation \(ax^2+bx+c=0\) are called its roots. Similarly, \(ax+b\) is called a binomial.</p>
<p>The first thing we do is compute the discriminant \(Δ=b^2-4ac\).</p>
<p>Then, there are 3 cases:</p>
<h4>If \(Δ \gt 0\):</h4>
<p>The trinomial has 2 roots, \(x_1=\cfrac{-b+\sqrt{Δ}}{2a}\) and \(x_2=\cfrac{-b-\sqrt{Δ}}{2a}\), and its sign behaves as follows:</p>
<img src="/inequalities/sign-table1-en.v1.png" alt="Sign chart of a trinomial with positive discriminant.">
<p>That is, the trinomial has the same sign as \(a\) on the interval \((-\infty,x_1) \cup (x_2,\infty)\), and opposite sign to \(a\) on \((x_1,x_2)\).</p>
<p>So, depending on the inequality symbol, we determine the interval.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>\(x^2-5x+6\) has \(Δ=1\) and roots \(x_1=2\) and \(x_2=3\). Its \(a\) is \(1 \gt 0\), so:</p>
<img src="/inequalities/example1.v1.png" alt="Sign chart of the trinomial.">
<p>Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(x^2-5x+6 \lt 0 \iff\) \(x \in (2,3)\)</li>
<li>\(x^2-5x+6 \le 0 \iff\) \(x \in [2,3]\)</li>
<li>\(x^2-5x+6 \gt 0 \iff\) \(x \in (-\infty,2) \cup (3,+\infty)\)</li>
<li>\(x^2-5x+6 \ge 0 \iff\) \(x \in (-\infty,2] \cup [3,+\infty)\)</li>
</ul>
<h4>If \(Δ=0\):</h4>
<p>The trinomial has one root, \(x_1=-\cfrac{b}{2a}\), and its sign behaves as follows:</p>
<img src="/inequalities/sign-table2-en.v1.png" alt="Sign table of a trinomial with zero discriminant.">
<p>That is, the trinomial has the same sign as \(a\) on the interval \((-\infty,x_1) \cup (x_1,+\infty)\), which can also be written as \(\mathbb{R} \setminus \{x_1\}\) or as \(x \neq x_1\).</p>
<p>So, depending on the inequality symbol, the solution interval follows.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>The trinomial \(-x^2+6x-9\) has \(Δ=0\) and root \(x_1=3\). Its \(a\) is \(-1 \lt 0\), therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(-x^2+6x-9 \lt 0 \iff\) \(x \neq 3\)</li>
<li>\(-x^2+6x-9 \le 0 \iff\) \(x \in \mathbb{R}\)</li>
<li>\(-x^2+6x-9 \gt 0\): no solution</li>
<li>\(-x^2+6x-9 \ge 0 \iff\) \(x=3\)</li>
</ul>
<h4>If \(Δ \lt 0\):</h4>
<p>The trinomial has no roots, and its sign behaves as follows:</p>
<img src="/inequalities/sign-table3-en.v1.png" alt="Sign table of a trinomial with negative discriminant.">
<p>That is, the trinomial has the same sign as \(a\) for all \(x \in \mathbb{R}\).</p>
<p>So, depending on the inequality symbol, the solution interval follows.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>The trinomial \(x^2+x+1\) has \(Δ=-3\), so no roots. Its \(a\) is \(1 \gt 0\), therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(x^2+x+1 \lt 0\): no solution</li>
<li>\(x^2+x+1 \le 0\): no solution</li>
<li>\(x^2+x+1 \gt 0 \iff\) \(x \in \mathbb{R}\)</li>
<li>\(x^2+x+1 \ge 0 \iff\) \(x \in \mathbb{R}\)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>We see that trinomials almost always have the same sign as their \(a\), except when there are 2 roots. Then, between them, the trinomial has the opposite sign of \(a\).</p>
<p>And of course, at their roots trinomials are neither positive nor negative, since they are zero.</p>
<p>Usually, inequalities won’t initially be in these standard forms, so we’ll need to rearrange them to match. We do this by "moving" everything to the left (or right), leaving 0 on the other side. Then we simplify and end up with the trinomial.</p>

<h2 id="inequalities-with-absolute-value">Inequalities With Absolute Values</h2>
<!--space for ad-->
<p>We will need the following absolute value properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(|x| \lt a \iff -a \lt x \lt a\)</li>
<li>\(|x| \gt a \iff x \lt -a \quad\) or \(\quad x \gt a\)</li>
<li>\(a \lt |x| \lt b \iff\) \(a \lt |x| \quad\) and \(\quad |x| \lt b\)</li>
</ul>
<h3>1st Degree</h3>
<p>There are 13 cases:</p>
<h4>\(|ax+b| \lt c\), with \(c \le 0\)</h4>
<p>Every absolute value is greater than or equal to \(0\), so the inequality has no solution.</p>
<h4>\(|ax+b| \lt c\), with \(c \gt 0\)</h4>
<p class="math-container">\(! \, |ax+b| \lt c \iff -c \lt ax+b \lt c \iff -c-b \lt ax+b-b \lt c-b \iff -c-b \lt ax \lt c-b\)</p>
<p>We divide all 3 parts by \(a\), and depending on its sign, the inequality direction is preserved or flipped.</p>
<p class="math-container">\(!\) E.g. \(|-4x+5| \lt 6 \iff -6 \lt -4x+5 \lt 6 \iff -11 \lt -4x \lt 1 \iff \cfrac{-11}{-4} \gt x \gt \cfrac{1}{-4} \iff -\cfrac{1}{4} \lt x \lt \cfrac{11}{4} \iff x \in \left(-\cfrac{1}{4},\cfrac{11}{4}\right)\)</p>
<h4>\(|ax+b| \le c\), with \(c \lt 0\)</h4>
<p>Every absolute value is greater than or equal to \(0\), so the inequality has no solution.</p>
<h4>\(|ax+b| \le 0\)</h4>
<p class="math-container">\(! \,|ax+b| \le 0 \iff |ax+b|=0 \iff ax+b=0 \iff x=-\cfrac{b}{a}\)</p>
<h4>\(|ax+b| \le c\), with \(c \gt 0\)</h4>
<p class="math-container">\(! \, |ax+b| \le c \iff -c \lt ax+b \le c \iff -c-b \le ax+b-b \le c-b \iff -c-b \le ax \le c-b\)</p>
<p>We divide all 3 parts by \(a\), and depending on its sign, the inequality direction is preserved or flipped.</p>
<p class="math-container">\(!\) E.g. \(|-4x+5| \le 6 \iff -6 \le -4x+5 \le 6 \iff -11 \le -4x \le 1 \iff \cfrac{-11}{-4} \ge x \ge \cfrac{1}{-4} \iff -\cfrac{1}{4} \le x \le \cfrac{11}{4} \iff x \in \left[-\cfrac{1}{4},\cfrac{11}{4}\right]\)</p>
<h4>\(|ax+b| \gt c\), with \(c \lt 0\)</h4>
<p>True for all \(x \in \mathbb{R}\)</p>
<h4>\(|ax+b| \gt 0\)</h4>
<p>The absolute value is always \(\ge 0\), so the inequality "wants" it to not be zero. Therefore:</p>
<p class="math-container">\(! \, |ax+b| \gt 0 \iff ax+b \neq 0 \iff x \neq -\cfrac{b}{a}\)</p>
<h4>\(|ax+b| \gt c\), with \(c \gt 0\)</h4>
<p class="math-container">\(! \, |ax+b| \gt c \iff ax+b \lt -c \quad\) or \(\quad ax+b \gt c \iff ax \lt -c-b \quad\) or \(\quad ax \gt c-b\)</p>
<p>We divide both inequalities by \(a\), and depending on its sign, the direction is preserved or flipped.</p>
<p class="math-container">\(!\) E.g. \(|-4x+5| \gt 6 \iff -4x+5 \lt -6 \quad\) or \(\quad -4x+5 \gt 6 \iff -4x \lt -11 \quad\) or \(\quad -4x \gt 1 \iff x \gt \cfrac{11}{4} \quad\) or \(\quad x \lt -\cfrac{1}{4} \iff x \in \left(-\infty,-\cfrac{1}{4}\right) \cup \left(\cfrac{11}{4},+\infty\right)\)</p>
<h4>\(|ax+b| \ge c\)</h4>
<p>If \(c \le 0\), true for all \(x \in \mathbb{R}\), otherwise (if \(c \gt 0\)) we proceed as in the previous case (\(|ax+b| \gt c\)).</p>
<h4>\(|ax+b| \lt cx+d\)</h4>
<p>We first need to set the condition \(cx+d \gt 0\) because if \(cx+d \le 0\), then \(|ax+b|\) would have to be negative, which is not possible. So we first solve \(cx+d \gt 0\) and then:</p>
<p class="math-container">\(! \, |ax+b| \lt cx+d \iff -(cx+d) \lt ax+b \lt cx+d \iff -(cx+d) \lt ax+b \quad\) and \(\quad ax+b \lt cx+d\)</p>
<p>We split the three-part inequality into 2, both of which we know how to solve.</p>
<p>Once solved, up to 3 intervals for \(x\) will result (including the condition we started with).</p>
<p>The solution is the intersection of these intervals.</p>
<p>We do the same for the \(\le\) case, with the condition \(cx+d \ge 0\) (it can be 0 here since the inequality is \(\le\)).</p>
<p>Example: \(|x+1| \lt 3x+2\)</p>
<p>We need: \(3x+2 \gt 0 \iff\) \(x \gt -\cfrac{2}{3}\)</p>
<p class="math-container">\(! \, |x+1| \lt 3x+2 \iff -(3x+2) \lt x+1 \lt 3x+2 \iff -3x-2 \lt x+1 \quad\) and \(\quad x+1 \lt 3x+2 \iff x \gt -\cfrac{3}{4} \quad\) and \(\quad x \gt -\cfrac{1}{2}\)</p>
<p>We want \(x \gt -\cfrac{2}{3}\), \(x \gt -\cfrac{3}{4}\), and \(x \gt -\cfrac{1}{2}\), so \(x \in \left(-\cfrac{1}{2},+\infty\right)\)</p>
<h4>\(|ax+b| \gt cx+d\)</h4>
<p class="math-container">\(! \, |ax+b| \gt cx+d \iff ax+b \lt -(cx+d) \quad\) or \(\quad ax+b \gt cx+d\)</p>
<p>We solve the two inequalities and find the interval.</p>
<p>We do the same when we have \(\ge\).</p>
<h4>\(|ax+b| \lt |cx+d|\)</h4>
<p class="math-container">\(! \, |ax+b| \lt |cx+d| \iff -|cx+d| \lt ax+b \lt |cx+d| \iff -|cx+d| \lt ax+b \quad\) and \(\quad ax+b \lt |cx+d| \iff |cx+d| \gt -(ax+b) \quad\) and \(\quad |cx+d| \gt ax+b\)</p>
<p>We must solve the two inequalities, which fall under the cases we discussed earlier.</p>
<p>We will get one interval (or union of intervals) from each and the solution is their intersection.</p>
<p>We do the same when we have \(\le\).</p>
<h4>\(|ax+b| \gt |cx+d|\)</h4>
<p class="math-container">\(! \, |ax+b| \gt |cx+d| \iff ax+b \lt -|cx+d| \quad\) or \(\quad ax+b \gt |cx+d| \iff |cx+d| \lt -(ax+b) \quad\) or \(\quad |cx+d| \lt ax+b\)</p>
<p>We must solve the two inequalities, which fall under the cases we discussed earlier.</p>
<p>We will get one interval from each and the solution is their union.</p>
<p>We do the same when we have \(\ge\).</p>
<h4>Important note</h4>
<p>Whether we need a union or an intersection for the intervals depends on the logical operators "or" and "and".<br>"Or" means union, while "and" means intersection.</p>
<h3>2nd Degree</h3>
<p>The procedure for removing the absolute value is exactly the same as in the linear inequalities. The only difference is that instead of binomials, we'll have to solve trinomials.</p>
<p>There is also the case where we have both types. For example:</p>
<p class="math-container">\(! \, |x^2-4x+6| \le 2x+1 \iff -(2x+1) \le x^2-4x+6 \le 2x+1 \iff -2x-1 \le x^2-4x+6 \quad\) and \(\quad x^2-4x+6 \le 2x+1 \iff -x^2+2x-7 \le 0 \quad\) and \(\quad x^2-6x+5 \le 0\)</p>
<p>For the first one: \(Δ=-24\) with \(a=-1 \lt 0\), so \(-x^2+2x-7 \le 0 \iff x \in \mathbb{R}\)</p>
<p>For the second: \(Δ=16\) with roots \(1\) and \(5\) and \(a=1 \gt 0\), so \(x^2-6x+5 \le 0 \iff x \in [1,5]\)</p>
<p>Therefore, the final answer is the intersection of \(\mathbb{R}\) with \([1,5]\), which is \([1,5]\).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="parametric-inequalities">Parametric Inequalities</h2>
<!--space for ad-->
<p>These are inequalities in which we also have another letter (usually \(λ\)), in addition to the variable, which is called a parameter.</p>
<p>In parametric inequalities, our goal is to determine what happens in the inequality for each \(λ \in \mathbb{R}\).</p>
<h3>1st Degree</h3>
<p>Procedure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move all \(x\) terms to the left and everything else to the right.</li>
<li>We must bring the inequality to the form \(ax \lt b\) (or \(\gt, \ge, \le\)), where \(a,b\) may involve the parameter. This is done by factoring out \(x\).</li>
<li>Finally, we distinguish the three cases we saw at the beginning: \(a \lt 0\), \(a=0\), and \(a \gt 0\)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example: \(2λx+4λ \lt 4x+8-λ\)</p>
<p>This becomes: \(2λx-4x \lt -4λ+8-λ \iff\) \((2λ-4)x \lt 8-5λ\), i.e., in the form \(ax \lt b\), with \(a=2λ-4\) and \(b=8-5λ\)</p>
<ul>
<li>If \(2λ-4 \lt 0 \iff λ \lt 2\), then the inequality becomes: \(x \gt \cfrac{8-5λ}{2λ-4}\), so \(x \in \left(\cfrac{8-5λ}{2λ-4},+\infty\right)\)</li>
<li>If \(2λ-4=0 \iff λ=2\), then the inequality becomes: \(0 \lt -2\), which is false, so the inequality has no solution.</li>
<li>If \(2λ-4 \gt 0 \iff λ \gt 2\), then the inequality becomes: \(x \lt \cfrac{8-5λ}{2λ-4}\), so \(x \in \left(-\infty,\cfrac{8-5λ}{2λ-4}\right)\)</li>
</ul>
<h3>2nd Degree</h3>
<p>In quadratic parametric inequalities, we are usually asked about specific properties of the trinomial. That is, we want to find for which values of \(λ \in \mathbb{R}\) the expression \(ax^2 + bx + c\):</p>

<p>For example, consider \((λ+2)x^2‒2λx+3λ\)</p>

<p>The discriminant is a quadratic with \(λ\) as the variable, so to determine its sign, we find its roots.</p>

<h2 id="trinomial-factorization">Trinomial Factorization</h2>
<p>We will see how to factor a trinomial of the form \(ax^2+bx+c\).</p>
<p>First, we find the Discriminant and the roots, if they exist. Then:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>If:</th><th>then:</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>\(Δ \gt 0\) and the roots are \(x_1,x_2\)</td><td>\(ax^2+bx+c=\) \(a(x-x_1)(x-x_2)\)</td></tr>
<tr><td>\(Δ=0\) and the root is \(x_1\)</td><td>\(ax^2+bx+c=\) \(a(x-x_1)^2\)</td></tr>
<tr><td>\(Δ \lt 0\)</td><td>the trinomial cannot be factored</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Also, if the trinomial is not in full form, we can immediately write:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(ax^2+bx=x(ax+b)\)</li>
<li>\(x^2-c=(x-\sqrt{c})(x+\sqrt{c})\) for \(c \ge 0\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(2x^2+8x+8=2(x+2)^2\)</li>
<li>\(13x^2+5x=x(13x+5)\)</li>
<li>\(x^2-64=(x-8)(x+8)\)</li>
<li>\(x^2-5x+6=(x-2)(x-3)\)</li>
<li>\(x^2+x+1\): cannot be factored.</li>

<h2 id="inequalities-with-products">Inequalities With Products</h2>
<p>We will see how to solve inequalities of the form \(f(x) \cdot g(x) \dots h(x) \lt 0\), where \(f(x),g(x),\dots,h(x)\) are either binomials or trinomials.</p>
<p>Also, instead of \(\lt\), we might have any of the other relations.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to show the process in general, so we’ll look at an example instead.</p>
<p>We consider the inequality \(2x(x-4)(x^2-1)(x^2+x+13) \lt 0\). Regardless of the inequality symbol, we must determine the sign of the product for each \(x \in \mathbb{R}\).</p>
<p>First of all, we check whether any of the trinomials can be factored into binomials. Here we can, since \(x^2-1=(x-1)(x+1)\). So:</p>
<p class="math-container">\(! \, 2x(x-4)(x^2-1)(x^2+x+13) \lt 0 \iff 2x(x-4)(x-1)(x+1)(x^2+x+13) \lt 0\)</p>
<p>Next, we check if there is any factor that is positive for all \(x \in \mathbb{R}\), because if there is, it does not affect the sign of the product and we can remove it. The trinomial \(x^2+x+13\) has a negative discriminant and \(a=1 \gt 0\), so it is always positive. Thus:</p>
<p class="math-container">\(! \, 2x(x-4)(x-1)(x+1)(x^2+x+13) \lt 0 \iff 2x(x-4)(x-1)(x+1) \lt 0\)</p>
<h3>Note:</h3>
<p>If there is a trinomial that is always negative, we can remove this as well, but we must reverse the direction of the inequality (and mention we are doing so because it is negative for all \(x \in \mathbb{R}\), in case we are solving this in an exam so the reasoning is clear).</p>
<p>We can also remove trinomials that are always non-negative or non-positive <u>only</u> in cases where the inequality is \(\lt 0\) or \(\gt 0\), because for \(\le,\ge\) we also care about when the product becomes zero.</p>
<p>We continue.</p>
<p>So we have the product \(2x(x-4)(x-1)(x+1)\).</p>
<p>Now we must create a sign table where each row corresponds to one factor with its signs, and the last row shows the product with its signs.</p>
<p>For the individual factors, the signs are easy to determine since they’re binomials. For the product (which we name \(P(x)\) in the table), we count the number of \(-\) signs in each column:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is an even number of \(-\) (or none), the sign of the product in that interval is \(+\).</li>
<li>If there is an odd number, then the sign of the product is also \(-\).</li>
</ul>
<p>So:</p>
<img src="/inequalities/example2.v1.png" alt="Sign table of the product.">
<p>\(*\) The numbers in the top row of the table that define the intervals are the roots of the factors.</p>
<p>Having the table, we can solve any inequality involving this product. We want \(P(x) \lt 0\), so the solution is \(x \in (-1,0) \cup (1,4)\).</p>
<p>We can check for mistakes by plugging in a number from each interval and checking whether the result matches the signs we found. This doesn’t guarantee that the intervals are correct, but if there is a mistake it’s likely to show up, since the sign changes by intervals and not by individual values.</p>
<p>For example, for \(x=-2\) the product becomes \(72 \gt 0\), which matches our result. Trying \(-\cfrac{1}{2},\cfrac{1}{2},2\), and \(5\) gives the signs we expected, so we are probably correct.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="inequalities-with-fractions">Inequalities With Fractions</h2>
<p>We will see how to solve inequalities of the form \(\cfrac{f(x) \cdot g(x) \dots h(x)}{k(x) \cdot m(x) \dots n(x)} \lt 0\), where \(f(x),g(x)\), etc., are binomials and trinomials.</p>
<p>Also, instead of \(\lt\), we might have any of the other relations.</p>
<p>This category includes inequalities involving fractions. To solve them, we must bring everything to one side of the inequality, make the fractions like terms, add them, and factor the numerator and denominator to bring them to this form. Then we do the following:</p>
<p>Since we care about the sign and not the value of the fraction, it makes no difference to examine the sign of the product (numerator \(\cdot\) denominator) instead. So:</p>
<p class="math-container">\(! \, \cfrac{f(x) \cdot g(x) \dots h(x)}{k(x) \cdot m(x) \dots n(x)} \lt 0 \iff f(x) \cdot g(x) \dots h(x) \cdot k(x) \cdot m(x) \dots n(x) \lt 0\)</p>
<p>Now we have a product, so we follow the same procedure as before.</p>
<p>Example: \(\cfrac{x^2-9}{2x-2}+x-3 \gt 0\).</p>
<p>We must turn \(x-3\) into a fraction with the same denominator as the other one so we can add them and factor numerator and denominator. So:</p>
<p class="math-container">\(! \, \cfrac{x^2-9}{2x-2}+x-3 \gt 0 \iff \cfrac{(x-3)(x+3)}{2(x-1)}+\cfrac{2(x-1)(x-3)}{2(x-1)} \gt 0 \iff \cfrac{(x-3)(x+3)+2(x-1)(x-3)}{2(x-1)} \gt 0 \iff \cfrac{(x-3)((x+3)+2(x-1))}{2(x-1)} \gt 0 \iff \cfrac{(x-3)(3x+1)}{2(x-1)} \gt 0\)</p>
<p>We take the product instead of the fraction: \(\cfrac{(x-3)(3x+1)}{2(x-1)} \gt 0 \iff\) \(2(x-1)(x-3)(3x+1) \gt 0\)</p>
<p>We make a sign table and determine the signs.</p>
